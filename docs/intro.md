# Savvy Guides

Welcome to Savvy Guides<br/>
This is where I document the exciting progress of creating a virtually infinite media library using Debrid services, Usenet, and media servers by utilising well-known and custom apps, created by the community.

## Recommended Debrid Services

:::info
The main ingredient to these guides is your debrid service.<br/>
Here are my recommendations:
:::

[**https://real-debrid.com**](http://real-debrid.com/?id=8999543)<br/>
Real-debrid is easily the king of debrid services with almost everything already cached except for a few niche searches.<br/>
Most of the guides in here revolve around it, so why not join up!


[**https://torbox.app**](https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=6b63e436-5976-4f61-83ca-2248d214bee1)<br/>
Torbox is the next up-and-coming debrid service with the ability to seed your torrents and also cache Usenet content.<br/>
A few of the community apps already support it with the likes of [Riven](/riven/) and [Blackhole](/blackhole/).
